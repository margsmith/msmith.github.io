<p>During my time at Virginia Tech, many people have asked me the one question that
almost every English major student fears: “What do you plan on doing with an English
degree?” After almost four full years as an English major, I still continue to answer this
question. However, my response has changed over the years. At first, my freshman self always
answered the question with frustration and offense. Now, as a current senior, my reply is
supported by my sense of confidence because I know that my experiences and coursework have
prepared me for the future. Today, so many people underestimate the value of this degree, but
as I reflect on my time as an English major at Virginia Tech, I know that I have gained so much
knowledge from my peers, professors, and employers.</p>
<br>
<p>Within the English major itself, I am enrolled in the Professional Writing program. The
concentration is meant to prepare students to write and develop documents for various
organizations. This type of writing initially appealed to me because I felt that it gave me so
many options for my future. In one of my classes, Creating User Documentation, I planned,
researched, and wrote projects in diverse technical writing genres. My final project
encompassed the skills that I learned throughout the semester. I collaborated with a classmate in
the redesign of the Virginia Tech Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
guidelines for ergonomics in the workplace. The main goal of the project was to revise the
original document for readability and usability. Not only did this course provide me with a
solid experience in the technical writing field, but it also enhanced my skills in HTML and XML.
On the other hand, I took a class called Designing Documents for Print, which explored a
graphic design facet within Professional Writing. In this course, we designed multiple
documents for clients including brochures, posters, and business cards. I learned about proper
document design principles and improved my skills in Adobe software. Overall, my
coursework has given me the opportunity to develop new skills for the workplace and to
improve my proficiency in different software materials.</p>
<br>
<p>Outside of the classroom, I have had diverse work experiences that have helped me
explore my career options for the future. One of my favorite writing experiences took place this
past summer, when I held an internship at WholeFoods Magazine as an Editorial Writer. My
main duty was to research and write articles that discussed the latest ingredient, product, and
technology developments in the health industry. For two of my published articles, I had the
pleasure of coordinating and conducting interviews with Howard Schiffer, the Founder of
Vitamin Angels, and Onna Young, Board President of Nourish America. Other duties I had
during my internship included strategizing the company’s B2B marketing plan through its
social media platforms, proofreading articles for publication, and editing product write-ups for
publication.</p>
<br>
<p>Now, as I approach graduation, I am extremely happy with what I have accomplished as
an English major at Virginia Tech. I hope to set an example for others and show that my degree
has given me workplace advantages such as critical thinking, communication, writing, and
editing skills.</p>
